## General Disclaimer

This is a personal repository to manage development preferences. I periodically update this repos as I find things useful here and there. There are hard-coded paths here and there, so I imagine this repo doesn't *Just Workâ„¢* on other machines. That said, I do run this repository for both work and personal macs (running the latest OSX).
